STOCK TREND PREDICTION 

DESCRIPTION:
The app is built using Python and Streamlit, leveraging libraries such as yfinance for data collection and pandas for data handling. The predictive model is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network trained using Keras, known for its capability to process time series data effectively. Users can visualize closing price trends over time, compare actual vs. predicted prices, and analyze stock performance with the help of moving averages. This tool aims to simplify stock analysis, providing real-time insights and aiding in better investment strategies.
